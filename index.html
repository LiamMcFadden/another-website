        <h4>NSA Cyber Exercise | <i>March 2022</i></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/NSA-Cyber-Exercise/" target="_blank">NSA Cyber Exercise (NCX)</a> is a three day long CTF style competition between all the Senior Military Colleges (SMC) and Military Academies. I competed in the Software Engineering module and helped my team to build and break a control pannel meant to regulate pipelines. Overall, my team took 5th place, beating all the other SMCs.

        <h4>Army Cyber Institute | <i>July 2021 - August 2021</i></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://cyber.army.mil/" target="_blank">Army Cyber Institute (ACI)</a> is the US Army's facility for research, advice, and education in the cyber domain. During my time there, I worked with a fellow intern to port a large MATLAB project to Python3. To facilitate the porting process, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/LiamMcFadden/Matlab-Functions-in-Python/blob/master/matlab_funcs.py" target="_blank">small python library</a> for converting MATLAB syntax to python. I also designed and implemented a tool for the creation of configuration files for the MATLAB program using Tkinter. At the end of the internship I was rated in the top 2 out of the 30 interns in my cohort.

        <h4>Vector Rideshare | <i>April 2020 - June 2021</i></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Vector Rideshare was a student led startup that aimed to provide a more community oriented approach to ridesharing with a focus on universities. I worked on the product development team and let a three person subteam. I held weekly team meetings where I helped to teach basic skills such as Git and the command line and got status updates on various projects that teammates were working on. I worked primarily in TypeScript and React on developing the backend of a game to be integrated into the main app as well as a dashboard for tracking rider covid status. My experience at Vector Rideshare gave me a valuable insight as to what it takes to work with a small team in a startup environment in its earliest stages.
